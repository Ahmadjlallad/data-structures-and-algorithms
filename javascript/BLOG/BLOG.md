# My lovey algos

- ## Insertion Sort

  - ### Big O:

  - Time: O(n^2)
    The basic operation of this algorithm is comparison. This will happen n \* (n-1) number of times…concluding the algorithm to be n squared.
    -Space: O(1)
    No additional space is being created. This array is being sorted in place…keeping the space at constant O(1).

- ## merge Sort

  How do you explain merge sort?
  Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

  - ### Big O:

  - Time: O(n log(n))
    This algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm. It is a recursive algorithm.
    -Space: O(n)
  - Space: O(1)
    This algorithm requires additional space proportional to the input size.
