# Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).

## Challenge

need to create a singly linked list class that create a linked list and append to head if the list is empty, otherwise append to next node.

- Code Challenge: Class 05: Singly Linked List
  - single liked list class with one method: append
- Code Challenge: Class 06: Extend a Linked List to allow various insertion methods.
  - Extend a linked list class to allow various insertion methods and delete methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
