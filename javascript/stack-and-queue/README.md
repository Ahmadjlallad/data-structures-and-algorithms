# Stacks and Queues

stack algorithms are a set of algorithms that operate on a data structure called a stack.
queue algorithms are a set of algorithms that operate on a data structure called a queue.

## Challenge 1

Implement a stack and a queue using only JavaScript.
with the following methods:

- push
- pop
- peek
- isEmpty

## Approach & Efficiency

stack and queues O(n) time and O(n) space.

## Challenge 2 pseudo queue

- Implement a queue using only two stack instant.

## Challenge 3 Animal Shelter

- Implement Animal Shelter class that can enqueue, dequeue, and find the front of the queue.
  - enqueue: add animal to the shelter
  - dequeue: remove the oldest animal from the shelter

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

- The first stack is the main stack.
- The second stack is a temporary stack.
  stack and queues O(n) time and O(n) space.
- Animal Shelter
  - enqueue: O(1)
  - dequeue: O(n)
