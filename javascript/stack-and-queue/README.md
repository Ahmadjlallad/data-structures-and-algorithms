# Stacks and Queues

stack algorithms are a set of algorithms that operate on a data structure called a stack.
queue algorithms are a set of algorithms that operate on a data structure called a queue.

## Challenge 1

Implement a stack and a queue using only JavaScript.
with the following methods:

- push
- pop
- peek
- isEmpty

## Approach & Efficiency

stack and queues O(n) time and O(n) space.

## Challenge 2 pseudo queue

- Implement a queue using only two stack instant.

## Whiteboard Process

whiteboard solution:
![pseudo Queue](./assets/pseudoQueue.png)

## Approach & Efficiency

- The first stack is the main stack.
- The second stack is a temporary stack.
  stack and queues O(n) time and O(n) space.
