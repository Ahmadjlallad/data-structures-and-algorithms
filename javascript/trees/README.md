# Trees

- binary tree are a data structure that consists of a node and two child nodes.

## Challenge

Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Binary Tree
- Create a Binary Tree class

  - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
    - pre order traversal (root, left, right)
    - in order traversal (left, root, right)
    - post order traversal (left, right, root)

- Binary Search Tree
  - Create a Binary Search Tree class
  - Add
    Arguments: value
    Return: nothing
    Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - Contains
    Argument: value
    Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency

- pre order traversal O(n)
- in order traversal O(n)
- post order traversal O(n)
- add in a binary search tree O(log n)
- contains in a binary search tree O(log n)
- Maximum number O(n)
- Breadth First O(n)
- treeFizzBuzz O(n)
