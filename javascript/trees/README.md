# Trees

- binary tree are a data structure that consists of a node and two child nodes.

## Challenge

Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Binary Tree
- Create a Binary Tree class

  - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
    - pre order
    - in order

- Binary Search Tree
  - Create a Binary Search Tree class
  - Add
    Arguments: value
    Return: nothing
    Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - Contains
    Argument: value
    Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
