## Challenge Description: tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.

tree_intersection should return a new hash table containing keys that appear in both trees, and values that are the number of times the key appears in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

- using depth-first search, we can traverse the tree and keep track of the current node's value and its children
- big
  time: O(n) time and space
  space: O(n)
